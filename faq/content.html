        <div class="faq-item">
            <h1>I don't know anyone. Will I find a team?</h1>
            <p>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/sketch-city/project-ideas/issues" target="_blank">Hackathon Project Ideas List</a> to find a project you might like, or create your own project. We do encourage choosing a project idea and finding possible teammates ahead of time, since we only have 24 hours! Teams can range from 2-20 people, but the ideal size depends on your idea and ability to manage it. Generally, 3-5 people works out well, though there have been great solo team and great 10+ person teams.</p>
