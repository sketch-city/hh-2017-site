            <h2>General Info</h2>
            <p>We’re so excited that more than 300 people have registered for this event! You all bring so much awesomeness to the table. But because of such a great turnout, the event organizers are going to be very busy. You can help by reading this document and sharing information with your teammates.</p>
            <p>If you have questions during the event, please post them to the #hackathon Slack channel, and a fabulous hackathon volunteer will reply promptly. Because of the scope of the event, we may not be able to answer your questions as quickly via other methods (Meetup, email, phone, etc.). Slack is where it’s at. <a target="_blank" href="http://sketchcity.herokuapp.com/">Get an automatic invite here.</a></p>
            <p>Also, in person, look for volunteers who have special color-coded name tags. They’re happy to help! Additionally, the Sketch City organizers of this event are Jeff Reichman, Neeraj Tandon, Randy Baxley, and Meredith Maines. Share your favorite moments using #houhackathon2017</p>

            <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
            <p>Also, we we want everyone to feel welcome, safe, and free to work on civic projects with teams or on their own at the hackathon and all Sketch City events. Please read and abide by the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/srigdon/codeofconduct/blob/62fccd30ef5895f53ada1fac3494dd39031cc29f/README.md">code of conduct</a>. If you feel uncomfortable at any time during the hackathon, please come find one of the organizers so we can help. Or email us at <a href="mailto: info@sketchcity.org">info@sketchcity.org</a>, and we’ll get right back to you.</p>
            <h2>Submitting Your Project</h2>
            <p>Your work must be accessible via the internet, and a link to your project and presentation must be submitted using Devpost by 12 PM Sunday. We recommend registering for Devpost early and assembling your team.</p>
            <p>There is only one presentation computer. You will not be allowed to use your own computer or transfer any files with external drives or connect other media, etc. Your presentation and/or project demo must live on the internet and must be linked to through your Devpost submission.</p>
            <p>Because there will be potentially 30+ presentations, we want to minimize transitions between teams (since that can add up to an hour or more of lag time). Please respect your fellow hackathon-ers by being prepared.</p>
            <h2>Presenting your project</h2>
            <p>Each team has three minutes to present their work. To help you stay on track, we’ll be displaying a digital timer. We’ll signal your cut off at the end of three minutes. It’s nothing personal; we just need to respect all the teams and our judges.</p>
            <p>Your work must be accessible via the internet, and the link must be posted on Devpost.  Here are some ways that people present hackathon projects:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li><p>Through a presentation (using something like SlideShare or Google Slides with a shareable URL)</p></li>
            	<li><p>Through a screencast or video (there are lots of tools you can use, such as Quickcast)</p></li>
            	<li><p>Through a live product demo on your web-based project.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you build a mobile app, you will not have the opportunity to connect the device to the projector.  We recommend making a video instead.</p>
            <p>It’s helpful to have one main presenter who is responsible for hitting all of the bullet points and managing the clock. You are welcome to have multiple presenters, however.</p>
            <h2>Judging</h2>
            <p>There are a handful of judges from the Houston community.  They will be evaluating your project based on:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li><p>Relevance. Is this solving a need, answering a question, serving citizens, or otherwise making an impact?</p></li>
            	<li><p>Ambition. How big is the challenge that the project addresses?</p></li>
            	<li><p>Progress. How far did the team get? Working demos are better than static images.</p></li>
            	<li><p>Presentation. Did the team present their work in a compelling way? Was it easy to understand the project, the scope, and how far they got?</p></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Awards</h2>
            <p>The prizes are:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li><p>Follow up meeting with the Mayor to discuss your project (3 slots available)</p></li>
            	<li><p>Ongoing support from Sketch City to help bring your project to life</p></li>
            </ul>
